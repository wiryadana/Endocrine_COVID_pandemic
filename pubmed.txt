THE DROP IN THE PERCENTAGE OF ACTIVE INDIVIDUALS WITH OR WITHOUT MEDICATION OCCURRED WHEN COMPARING THE SCENARIOS BEFORE AND DURING QUARANTINE. HOWEVER, THE DIFFERENCE IN THE PREVALENCE OF ACTIVE INDIVIDUALS BETWEEN THE GROUPS WAS SIGNIFICANT, SHOWING THAT THE GROUP WITH MEDICATION REMAINED MORE ACTIVE. THE FEAR OF CONTAMINATION, THE MEASURES OF DISTANCE AND THE LACK OF ADHERENCE OF THE POPULATION TO CLASSES BY VIDEOCONFERENCE REDUCED THE FREQUENCY OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES IN THE GENERAL SAMPLE POPULATION.

THE PRESENT STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO REVEAL THE MOLECULAR MECHANISM OF TOUJIEQUWEN GRANULES AGAINST COVID-19. A NETWORK PHARMACOLOGICAL METHOD WAS APPLIED TO SCREEN THE MAIN ACTIVE INGREDIENTS OF TOUJIEQUWEN GRANULES. NETWORK ANALYSIS OF 149 ACTIVE INGREDIENTS AND 330 DRUG TARGETS SHOWED THE MOST ACTIVE INGREDIENT INTERACTING WITH MANY DRUG TARGETS IS QUERCETIN. DRUG TARGETS MOST AFFECTED BY THE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS WERE PTGS2, PTGS1, AND DPP4. DRUG TARGET DISEASE ENRICHMENT ANALYSIS SHOWED DRUG TARGETS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY ENRICHED IN CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES AND DIGESTIVE TRACT DISEASES. AN \"ACTIVE INGREDIENT-TARGET-DISEASE\" NETWORK SHOWED THAT 57 ACTIVE INGREDIENTS FROM TOUJIEQUWEN GRANULES INTERACTED WITH 15 KEY TARGETS OF COVID-19. THERE WERE 53 INGREDIENTS THAT COULD ACT ON DPP4, SUGGESTING THAT DPP4 MAY BECOME A POTENTIAL NEW KEY TARGET FOR THE TREATMENT OF COVID-19. GO ANALYSIS RESULTS SHOWED THAT KEY TARGETS WERE MAINLY ENRICHED IN THE CELLULAR RESPONSE TO LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE, CYTOKINE ACTIVITY AND OTHER FUNCTIONS. KEGG ANALYSIS SHOWED THEY WERE MAINLY CONCENTRATED IN VIRAL PROTEIN INTERACTION WITH CYTOKINE AND CYTOKINE RECEPTORS AND ENDOCRINE RESISTANCE PATHWAY.

THREE PHASES OF THE PANDEMIC WERE IDENTIFIED BASED ON THE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL SITUATION AND THE PUBLIC MEASURES ADOPTED FROM THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT (1ST PHASE: FROM 9TH MARCH TO 3RD MAY 2020; 2ND PHASE: FROM 4TH MAY TO 14TH JUNE; 3RD PHASE: FROM 15TH JUNE TO 31ST). THE PATIENTS OPERATED UPON DURING THESE PHASES WERE COMPARED TO THOSE WHO UNDERWENT SURGERY DURING THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PREVIOUS YEAR. OVERALL, 3892 PATIENTS FROM 28 ITALIAN ENDOCRINE SURGICAL UNITS WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY, 1478 (38%) OPERATED UPON DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC, AND 2414 (62%) DURING THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD OF 2019. THE DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF OPERATIONS WAS BY 64.8%, 44.7% AND 5.1% DURING THE THREE PHASES OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC, COMPARED TO 2019, RESPECTIVELY. DURING THE FIRST AND THE SECOND PHASES, THE SURGICAL ACTIVITY WAS DEDICATED MAINLY TO ONCOLOGICAL PATIENTS. NO DIFFERENCES IN POST-OPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS WERE NOTED BETWEEN THE TWO PERIODS.

THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON THE THYROID GLAND HAS BEEN DESCRIBED BUT SEVERAL ASPECTS HAVE TO BE CLARIFIED. THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WAS CONCEIVED TO ACHIEVE MORE SOLID INFORMATION ABOUT: 1) WHICH THYROID DISEASE OR DYSFUNCTION SHOULD BE EXPECTED IN COVID-19 PATIENTS; 2) WHETHER THYROID PATIENTS HAVE A HIGHER RISK OF SARS-COV-2 INFECTION; 3) WHETHER THE MANAGEMENT HAS TO BE ADAPTED IN THYROID PATIENT WHEN INFECTED. THE LITERATURE WAS SEARCHED BY TWO AUTHORS INDEPENDENTLY. A 5-STEP SEARCH STRATEGY WAS A PRIORI ADOPTED. ONLY REVIEWS FOCUSED ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THYROID AND COVID-19 WERE INCLUDED. THE LAST SEARCH WAS PERFORMED ON FEBRUARY 21  2021. TWO-HUNDRED-FORTY-SEVEN RECORDS WAS INITIALLY FOUND AND NINE REVIEWS WERE FINALLY INCLUDED. THE REVIEWS IDENTIFIED SEVERAL POTENTIAL THYROID CONSEQUENCES IN COVID-19 PATIENTS, SUCH AS THYROTOXICOSIS, LOW-T3 SYNDROME AND SUBACUTE THYROIDITIS, WHILE NO RELEVANT DATA WERE FOUND REGARDING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON THE MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS ON THYROID TREATMENT. THE PRESENT SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF REVIEWS FOUND THAT: 1) PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH COVID-19 CAN DEVELOP THYROID DYSFUNCTION, FREQUENTLY NON-THYROIDAL ILLNESS SYNDROME WHEN HOSPITALIZED IN INTENSIVE CARE UNIT, 2) HAVING A THYROID DISEASE DOES NOT INCREASE THE RISK FOR SARS-COV-2 INFECTION, 3) THYROID PATIENTS DO NOT NEED A COVID-19-ADAPTED FOLLOW-UP.

THUS, WE EVALUATED THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON THE PATTERN OF PRIMARY CARE CONSULTATIONS WITHIN A SHANGHAI HEALTH DISTRICT.   A RETROSPECTIVE OBSERVATIONAL COHORT STUDY WAS PERFORMED, WITH DATA ANALYZED CONCERNING THE PATTERN OF PATIENT VISITS TO GENERAL PRACTITIONERS WITHIN THE TONGREN HOSPITAL NETWORK (THE SOLE PROVIDER OF GENERAL PRACTICE TO THE POPULATION OF 700,000). DATA FROM ALL GENERAL PRACTICE CONSULTATIONS FOR ADULTS WERE COLLECTED FOR THE FIRST 6 MONTHS OF 2020, WHICH INCLUDED A 60-DAY LOCKDOWN PERIOD (JANUARY 24-MARCH 24, 2020) AND COMPARED TO CORRESPONDING DATA FROM THE FIRST 6 MONTHS OF 2019. WE EVALUATED CHANGES TO THE NUMBERS AND PATTERNS OF PRIMARY CARE CONSULTATIONS, INCLUDING SUBGROUP ANALYSIS BASED ON AGE, SEX, AND PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS.   A SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION IN PATIENT VISITS, ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED MEDIAN AGE, WAS OBSERVED DURING THE FIRST WAVE OF THE PANDEMIC IN THE FIRST 6 MONTHS OF 2020, COMPARED TO THE SAME INTERVAL DURING 2019. ADDITIONALLY, REDUCED REAPPOINTMENTS AND WAITING TIMES, BUT INCREASED COSTS PER VISIT WERE OBSERVED. WHEN ANALYZED BY PRIMARY DISEASE DIAGNOSIS, PATIENT VISITS WERE REDUCED FOR ALL THE MAJOR SYSTEMS. THE MOST STRIKING VISIT REDUCTIONS WERE IN CARDIOVASCULAR, RESPIRATORY, ENDOCRINE, AND GASTROINTESTINAL DISEASES. HOWEVER, PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDERS WERE INCREASED FOLLOWING LOCKDOWN, BUT THERE WAS ALSO A DRAMATIC FALL IN CONSULTATIONS FOR DEPRESSION. REDUCED MONTHLY PATIENT NUMBERS CORRELATED WITH BOTH RATE OF REAPPOINTMENT AND AVERAGE WAITING TIME DURING THE FIRST 6 MONTHS OF BOTH 2019 AND 2020, BUT AN INVERSE CORRELATION WAS OBSERVED BETWEEN COST PER VISIT AND MONTHLY PATIENT NUMBERS. SPECIFICALLY DURING THE LOCKDOWN PERIOD, THERE WAS ~50% REDUCED PATIENT VISITS.   THE LOCKDOWN HAS HAD A SERIOUS IMPACT ON PATIENTS' PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH. OUR ANALYSIS PROVIDES OBJECTIVE HEALTH-RELATED DATA THAT MAY INFORM THE CURRENT CONTROVERSY CONCERNING THE BALANCE BETWEEN THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS OF THE USE OF LOCKDOWN VS. THE USE OF A MORE TARGETED APPROACH TO ELIMINATE VIRAL TRANSMISSION. THESE DATA MAY IMPROVE DECISION-MAKING IN MEDICAL PRACTICE, POLICY, AND EDUCATION."

FEMALE COVID-19 PATIENTS OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE WERE RECRUITED BETWEEN JANUARY 28 AND MARCH 8, 2020 FROM TONGJI HOSPITAL IN WUHAN. THEIR BASELINE AND CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS, AS WELL AS MENSTRUAL CONDITIONS, WERE RECORDED. DIFFERENTIALS IN OVARIAN RESERVE MARKERS AND SEX HORMONES (INCLUDING ANTI-MÜLLERIAN HORMONE [AMH], FOLLICLE-STIMULATING HORMONE [FSH], THE RATIO OF FSH TO LUTEINIZING HORMONE [LH], ESTRADIOL [E2], PROGESTERONE [P], TESTOSTERONE [T], AND PROLACTIN [PRL] WERE COMPARED TO THOSE OF HEALTHY WOMEN WHO WERE RANDOMLY SELECTED AND INDIVIDUALLY MATCHED FOR AGE, REGION, AND MENSTRUAL STATUS. UNI- AND MULTI-VARIABLE HIERARCHICAL LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSES WERE PERFORMED TO IDENTIFY RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH OVARIAN FUNCTION IN COVID-19 WOMEN.   SEVENTY EIGHT PATIENTS AGREED TO BE TESTED FOR SERUM HORMONE, OF WHOM 17 (21.79%) WERE DIAGNOSED AS THE SEVERE GROUP AND 39 (50%) WERE IN THE BASAL LEVEL GROUP. MENSTRUAL STATUS (  = 0.55), MENSTRUAL VOLUMES (  = 0.066), PHASE OF MENSTRUAL CYCLE (  = 0.58), AND DYSMENORRHEA HISTORY (  = 0.12) WERE SIMILAR WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN NON-SEVERE AND SEVERE COVID-19 WOMEN. SIGNIFICANT LOWER SERUM AMH LEVEL/PROPORTION (0.19/0.28 VS. 1.12 NG/ML,   = 0.003/0.027; AMH ≤ 1.1 NG/ML: 75/70.4 VS. 49.7%,   = 0.009/0.004), HIGHER SERUM T (0.38/0.39 VS. 0.22 NG/ML,   < 0.001/0.001) AND PRL (25.43/24.10 VS. 12.12 NG/ML,   < 0.001/0.001) LEVELS WERE OBSERVED IN BASAL LEVEL AND THE ALL-COVID-19 GROUP COMPARED WITH HEALTHY AGE-MATCHED CONTROL. WHEN ADJUSTED FOR AGE, MENSTRUAL STATUS AND PARITY VARIATIONS IN MULTIVARIATE HIERARCHICAL LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS, COVID-19 DISEASE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH SERUM AMH (Β = -0.191; 95% CI: -1.177-0.327;   = 0.001), T (Β = 0.411; 95% CI: 11.154-22.709;   < 0.001), AND PRL (Β = 0.497; 95% CI: 10.787-20.266;   < 0.001), SUGGESTING AN INDEPENDENT RISK FACTOR FOR OVARIAN FUNCTION, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR 3.2% OF THE DECLINE IN AMH, 14.3% OF THE INCREASE IN T, AND 20.7% OF THE INCREASE IN PRL.

INCREASED SUSCEPTIBILITY TO COVID-19 HOSPITALIZATION AND MORTALITY HAVE BEEN LINKED TO ASSOCIATED COMORBIDITIES AS DIABETES, HYPERTENSION, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES AND, RECENTLY, TO OBESITY. SIMILARLY, INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH OBESITY ARE AT GREATER RISK TO DEVELOP CLINICAL COMPLICATIONS AND TO HAVE POOR PROGNOSIS IN SEVERE INFLUENZA PNEUMONIA. IMMUNE AND METABOLIC DYSFUNCTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCREASED SUSCEPTIBILITY TO INFLUENZA INFECTION ARE LINKED TO OBESITY-ASSOCIATED LOW-GRADE INFLAMMATION, COMPROMISED IMMUNE AND ENDOCRINE SYSTEMS, AND TO HIGH CARDIOVASCULAR RISK.

THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO DESCRIBE THE EFFECT OF LOCKDOWN-RELATED STRESS ON THE HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY-THYROID (HPT) AXIS IN A COHORT OF YOUNG MEN. A PROSPECTIVE, OBSERVATIONAL CLINICAL TRIAL WAS CARRIED OUT, INCLUDING PATIENTS ATTENDING THE MALE INFERTILITY OUTPATIENT CLINIC BEFORE AND AFTER THE NATIONAL LOCKDOWN FOR COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THE STUDY PROVIDED A BASELINE VISIT PERFORMED BEFORE AND A FOLLOW-UP VISIT AFTER THE LOCKDOWN IN 2020. DURING THE FOLLOW-UP VISIT, HORMONAL MEASUREMENTS, LIFESTYLE HABITS AND WORK MANAGEMENT WERE RECORDED. THIRTY-ONE MALE SUBJECTS WERE ENROLLED (MEAN AGE: 31.6 ± 6.0 YEARS). TSH SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED AFTER LOCKDOWN (P = 0.015), WHEREAS NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE OBSERVED IN THE TESTOSTERONE, LUTEINISING HORMONE, FOLLICLE-STIMULATING HORMONE, ESTRADIOL AND PROLACTIN SERUM LEVELS. NO PATIENT SHOWED TSH SERUM LEVELS ABOVE OR BELOW REFERENCE RANGES, NEITHER BEFORE NOR AFTER LOCKDOWN.

AGING COMES ALONG WITH CIRCADIAN ALTERATION, E.G. A DISRUPTED SLEEP AND INFLAMMATION, THAT LEADS TO METABOLIC DISORDERS. IN TURN, SLEEP CYCLE DISTURBANCES CAUSE NUMEROUS PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES THAT ACCELERATES THE AGING PROCESS. IN THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM, SLEEP DISRUPTION IMPAIRS SEVERAL FUNCTIONS, AMONG THEM, THE CLEARANCE OF WASTE MOLECULES. THE DECREASE OF PLASMA MELATONIN, A MOLECULE OF UNUSUAL PHYLOGENETIC CONSERVATION PRESENT IN ALL KNOWN AEROBIC ORGANISMS, PLAYS A PARTICULAR ROLE AS FAR AS THE ENDOCRINE SEQUELS OF AGING. EVERY DAY, THE LATE AFTERNOON/NOCTURNAL INCREASE OF MELATONIN SYNCHRONIZES BOTH THE CENTRAL CIRCADIAN PACEMAKER LOCATED IN THE HYPOTHALAMIC SUPRACHIASMATIC NUCLEI AS WELL AS MYRIADS OF PERIPHERAL CELLULAR CIRCADIAN CLOCKS. THIS IS CALLED THE \"CHRONOBIOTIC EFFECT\" OF MELATONIN, THE METHOXYINDOLE BEING THE PROTOTYPE OF THE ENDOGENOUS FAMILY OF CHRONOBIOTIC AGENTS. IN ADDITION, MELATONIN EXERTS A SIGNIFICANT CYTOPROTECTIVE ACTION BY BUFFERING FREE RADICALS AND REVERSING INFLAMMATION VIA DOWN REGULATION OF PROINFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES, SUPPRESSION OF LOW DEGREE INFLAMMATION AND PREVENTION OF INSULIN RESISTANCE. BECAUSE OF THESE PROPERTIES MELATONIN HAS BEEN ADVOCATED TO BE A POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC TOOL IN COVID 19 PANDEMIC. MELATONIN ADMINISTRATION TO AGED ANIMALS COUNTERACTS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF SENESCENCE-RELATED CHANGES. IN HUMANS, MELATONIN IS EFFECTIVE BOTH AS A CHRONOBIOTIC AND A CYTOPROTECTIVE AGENT TO MAINTAIN A HEALTHY AGING. CIRCULATING MELATONIN LEVELS ARE CONSISTENTLY REDUCED IN THE METABOLIC SYNDROME, ISCHEMIC AND NON-ISCHEMIC CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES AND NEURODEGENERATIVE DISORDERS LIKE THE ALZHEIMER'S AND PARKINSON'S DISEASES. THE POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC VALUE OF MELATONIN HAS BEEN SUGGESTED BY A LIMITED NUMBER OF CLINICAL TRIALS GENERALLY EMPLOYING MELATONIN IN THE 2-10MG/DAY RANGE. HOWEVER, FROM ANIMAL STUDIES THE CYTOPROTECTIVE EFFECTS OF MELATONIN NEED HIGHER DOSES TO BECOME APPARENT (I.E. IN THE 100MG/DAY RANGE).

FAILURE OF THE ENDOCRINE FEEDBACK TO OVERCOME AR SIGNALING DEFECTS BY INCREASING TESTOSTERONE LEVELS DURING THE INFECTION LEADS TO THE POLYQ TRACT BECOMING DOMINANT TO SERUM TESTOSTERONE LEVELS FOR THE CLINICAL OUTCOME.

CURRENTLY, THERE IS NO SPECIFIC TREATMENT OR APPROVED VACCINE AGAINST COVID-19. THE UNDERLYING ASSOCIATED COMORBIDITY AND DIMINISHED IMMUNE FUNCTION OF SOME PITUITARY PATIENTS (WHETHER CAUSED BY THE DISEASE AND ITS SEQUELAE OR TREATMENT WITH EXCESS GLUCOCORTICOIDS) INCREASES THEIR RISK OF CONTRACTING AND DEVELOPING COMPLICATIONS FROM COVID-19 INFECTION.

OLDER AGE AND PRE-EXISTING OBESITY, HYPERTENSION, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, AND DIABETES MELLITUS INCREASE THE RISK OF HOSPITALIZATION AND DEATH IN COVID-19 PATIENTS. MEN TEND TO BE MORE SEVERELY AFFECTED THAN WOMEN; FORTUNATELY, MOST MEN, PARTICULARLY OF YOUNGER AGE, SURVIVE THE INFECTION. IN ADDITION TO GENERAL COMORBIDITIES THAT MAY APPLY TO MANY PITUITARY PATIENTS, THEY ARE ALSO SUSCEPTIBLE DUE TO THE FOLLOWING PITUITARY DISORDER-SPECIFIC FEATURES: HYPERCORTISOLEMIA AND ADRENAL SUPPRESSION WITH CUSHING DISEASE, ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY AND DIABETES INSIPIDUS WITH HYPOPITUITARISM, AND SLEEP-APNEA SYNDROME AND CHEST WALL DEFORMITY WITH ACROMEGALY.

IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF COVID-19 ON CARE OF PATIENTS WITH ACROMEGALY, WE CONDUCTED AN INTERNATIONAL ONLINE SURVEY OF ENDOCRINOLOGISTS. THE QUESTIONNAIRE WAS DRAFTED BY A STEERING COMMITTEE OF ACROMEGALY EXPERTS AND COVERED BOTH RESPONDENT DEMOGRAPHICS, CONTACT AND COMMUNICATION WITH PATIENTS, AND PATIENT CARE. RESPONDENT AWARENESS WAS GENERATED THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGNS AND THE SURVEY COMPLETED ONLINE USING GOOGLE FORMS. THE MAJORITY OF ENDOCRINOLOGISTS WHO RESPONDED (N = 84) WERE BASED IN EUROPE (67.9%) AND WERE FEMALE (58.3%). SLIGHTLY MORE THAN HALF OF RESPONDENTS WORKED IN A SPECIALIZED PITUITARY CENTER (52.4%) AND A LARGE MINORITY CARED FOR MORE THAN 50 ACROMEGALY PATIENTS (47.6%). MOST RESPONDENTS (85.7%) INDICATED SURGERY WAS THEIR FIRST-LINE TREATMENT, WITH ONLY 14.3% INDICATING MEDICAL THERAPY AS A FIRST-CHOICE TREATMENT OPTION. ONE-THIRD (33.3%) OF RESPONDENTS REPORTED HAVING DELAYED A PLANNED SURGERY DUE TO A LACK OF COVID-19 TESTING PROVISION AND 54.8% DUE TO A LACK OF SURGICAL PROVISION; 19.1% INDICATED THAT A LACK OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT HAD REDUCED THEIR ABILITY TO TREAT PATIENTS WITH ACROMEGALY. JUST 21.4% OF RESPONDENTS REPORTED NO NEGATIVE EFFECTS FROM THE PANDEMIC ON DIAGNOSTIC PRACTICE PATTERNS, AND JUST 19.1% REPORTED NO NEGATIVE EFFECT ON PATIENT FOLLOW-UP PRACTICES. MANY RESPONDENTS (55.9%) INDICATED THAT REMOTE METHODS HAD IMPROVED THEIR ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR PATIENTS AND 69.0% INDICATED THAT THEY WOULD CONTINUE TO USE METHODS OF CONSULTATION NECESSITATED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. OUR DATA SUGGEST THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IS SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECTING THE CARE OF ACROMEGALY. HOWEVER, THESE RESULTS ALSO SUGGEST THAT ENDOCRINOLOGISTS ARE EMBRACING ASPECTS OF THE 'NEW NORMAL' TO CREATE A NOVEL CONTINUUM OF CARE BETTER SUITED TO THE PRESUMED POST-COVID-19 ENVIRONMENT.

CURRENTLY, THERE ARE NO GUIDELINES OR PROTOCOLS TO HELP ALTER THE COURSE OF SEX-SPECIFIC COVID-19 PROGNOSIS, ESPECIALLY IN SEVERE DISEASE PRESENTATIONS.

WE TOOK A BIOINFORMATICS APPROACH TO ANALYZE THE GENE AND PROTEIN EXPRESSION DATA OF THESE CORONAVIRUS RECEPTORS (DPP4, ANPEP, ENPEP, TMPRSS2) IN HUMAN NORMAL AND CANCER TISSUES OF MULTIPLE ORGANS INCLUDING THE BRAIN, LIVER, KIDNEY, HEART, LUNG, SKIN, GI TRACT, PANCREAS, ENDOCRINE TISSUES, AND THE REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS. RNA-SEQ DATA FROM THE CANCER GENOME ATLAS (TCGA) AND GTEX DATABASES WERE USED FOR EXTENSIVE PROFILING ANALYSIS OF THESE RECEPTORS ACROSS 9,736 TUMORS AND 8,587 NORMAL TISSUES COMPARING CORONAVIRUS RECEPTORS. PROTEIN EXPRESSION FROM IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY DATA WAS ASSESSED FROM THE HUMAN PROTEIN ATLAS DATABASE INCLUDING 144 SAMPLES, CORRESPONDING TO 48 DIFFERENT NORMAL HUMAN TISSUE TYPES, AND 432 TUMOR SAMPLES FROM 216 DIFFERENT CANCER PATIENTS. THE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN IMMUNE CELL INFILTRATION, CHEMOKINE, AND CYTOKINES WERE INVESTIGATED VIA TUMOR IMMUNE ESTIMATION RESOURCE (TIMER) AND TCGA.   WE FOUND THAT AMONG ALL, RENAL TUMOR AND NORMAL TISSUES EXHIBITED INCREASED LEVELS OF ACE2, DPP4, ANPEP, AND ENPEP. OUR RESULTS REVEALED THAT TMPRSS2 MAY NOT BE THE CO-RECEPTOR FOR CORONAVIRUS INFECTION IN RENAL CARCINOMA PATIENTS. THE OTHER RECEPTORS DPP4, ANPEP, AND ENPEP MAY ACT AS THE COMPENSATORY RECEPTOR PROTEINS TO HELP ACE2. THE RECEPTORS' EXPRESSION LEVELS WERE VARIABLE IN DIFFERENT TUMOR STAGE, MOLECULAR, AND IMMUNE SUBTYPES OF RENAL CARCINOMA. INTRIGUINGLY, IN CLEAR CELL RENAL CELL CARCINOMAS, CORONAVIRUS RECEPTORS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH IMMUNE INFILTRATION, MARKERS OF IMMUNOSUPPRESSION, AND T CELL EXHAUSTION.   OUR STUDY INDICATES THAT COV RECEPTORS MAY PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN MODULATING THE IMMUNE INFILTRATE AND HENCE CELLULAR IMMUNITY IN RENAL CARCINOMA.

THE URGENCY AND SEVERITY OF THE PANDEMIC FORCES THE USE OF SEGREGATION IN RESTRICTED AREAS AND CONFINEMENT IN INDIVIDUAL ROOMS AS DESPERATE STRATEGIES TO AVOID THE SPREAD OF DISEASE AND THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO OF BECOMING A DEADLY TRAP. THE CONCEPTUALIZATION OF THE POST-COVID-19 ERA IMPLIES STRONG EFFORTS TO REDESIGN ALL LIVING CONDITIONS, CARE/REHABILITATION INTERVENTIONS, AND MANAGEMENT OF LONELINESS FORCED BY SOCIAL DISTANCE MEASURES. RECENTLY, A STUDY OF GENDER DIFFERENCES IN COVID-19 FOUND THAT MEN ARE MORE LIKELY TO SUFFER MORE SEVERE EFFECTS OF THE DISEASE AND ARE OVER TWICE AS LIKELY TO DIE.

THE PRESENT STUDY EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF LONG-TERM ISOLATION IN MALE 3XTG-AD MICE MODELING ADVANCED STAGES OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD) AND AS COMPARED TO AGE-MATCHED COUNTERPARTS WITH NORMAL AGING. WE USED A BATTERY OF ETHOLOGICAL AND UNCONDITIONED TESTS RESEMBLING SEVERAL AREAS IN NURSING HOMES. THE MAIN FINDINGS REFER TO AN EXACERBATED (TWO-FOLD INCREASE) HYPERACTIVITY AND EMERGENCE OF BIZARRE BEHAVIORS IN ISOLATED 3XTG-AD MICE, WORRISOME RESULTS SINCE AGITATION IS A CHALLENGE IN THE CLINICAL MANAGEMENT OF DEMENTIA AND AN IMPORTANT CAUSE OF CAREGIVER BURDEN.

TO EXPLORE PUTATIVE LINKS BETWEEN EDCS AND COVID-19 SEVERITY, AN INTEGRATIVE SYSTEMS BIOLOGY APPROACH WAS CONSTRUCTED AND APPLIED. AS A FIRST STEP, RELEVANT DATA SETS WERE COMPILED FROM MAJOR DATA SOURCES. BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATIONS OF MAJOR EDCS TO PROTEINS WERE EXTRACTED FROM THE COMPTOX DATABASE. ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN PROTEINS AND DISEASES KNOWN AS IMPORTANT COVID-19 COMORBIDITIES WERE OBTAINED FROM THE GENECARDS AND DISGENET DATABASES.

SIGNALING PATHWAYS FOR COMMON PROTEINS WERE THEN INVESTIGATED BY OVER-REPRESENTATION ANALYSIS. WE FOUND SEVERAL STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT PATHWAYS THAT MAY BE DYSREGULATED BY EDCS AND THAT MAY ALSO BE INVOLVED IN COVID-19 SEVERITY.

THIS DOCUMENT AIMS TO SUMMARIZE RECENT EVIDENCE AND EXPERTS' OPINION AND FORMULATE RECOMMENDATIONS TO GUIDE THE SURGICAL COMMUNITY ON HOW TO BEST ORGANIZE THE RECOVERY PLAN FOR SURGICAL ACTIVITY ACROSS DIFFERENT SUB-SPECIALITIES AFTER THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. RECOMMENDATIONS WERE DEVELOPED THROUGH A DELPHI PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF EXPERT CONSENSUS. DOMAIN TOPICS WERE FORMULATED AND SUBSEQUENTLY SUBDIVIDED INTO QUESTIONS PERTINENT TO DIFFERENT SURGICAL SPECIALITIES FOLLOWING THE COVID-19 CRISIS. SIXTY-FIVE EXPERTS FROM 24 COUNTRIES, REPRESENTING THE ENTIRE EAES BOARD, WERE INVITED. FIFTY CLINICIANS AND SIX ENGINEERS ACCEPTED THE INVITATION AND DRAFTED STATEMENTS BASED ON SPECIFIC KEY QUESTIONS. ANONYMOUS VOTING ON THE STATEMENTS WAS PERFORMED UNTIL CONSENSUS WAS ACHIEVED, DEFINED BY AT LEAST 70% AGREEMENT. A TOTAL OF 92 CONSENSUS STATEMENTS WERE FORMULATED WITH REGARD TO SAFE RESUMPTION OF SURGERY ACROSS EIGHT DOMAINS, ADDRESSING GENERAL SURGERY, UPPER GI, LOWER GI, BARIATRICS, ENDOCRINE, HPB, ABDOMINAL WALL AND TECHNOLOGY/RESEARCH. THE STATEMENTS ADDRESSED ELECTIVE AND EMERGENCY SERVICES ACROSS ALL SUBSPECIALTIES WITH SPECIFIC ATTENTION TO THE ROLE OF MIS DURING THE RECOVERY PLAN. EIGHTY-FOUR OF THE STATEMENTS WERE APPROVED DURING THE FIRST ROUND OF DELPHI VOTING (91.3%) AND ANOTHER 8 DURING THE FOLLOWING ROUND AFTER SUBSTANTIAL MODIFICATION, RESULTING IN A 100% CONSENSUS. THE RECOMMENDATIONS FORMULATED BY THE EAES BOARD ESTABLISH A FRAMEWORK FOR RESUMPTION OF SURGERY FOLLOWING COVID-19 PANDEMIC WITH PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THE ROLE OF MIS ACROSS SURGICAL SPECIALITIES.

THIS LIMITATION IS PARTICULARLY CONCERNING AS PRELIMINARY DATA INDICATE THAT VETERANS MAY EXPERIENCE A HIGHER RATE OF MORTALITY COMPARED TO THEIR CIVILIAN COUNTERPARTS. ONE FACTOR THAT MAY CONTRIBUTE TO INCREASED RATES OF DEATH AMONG VETERANS WITH COVID-19 IS TOBACCO USE. INDEED, FINDINGS FROM A RECENT META-ANALYSIS HIGHLIGHT THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN LIFETIME SMOKING STATUS AND COVID-19 PROGRESSION TO MORE SEVERE OR CRITICAL CONDITIONS INCLUDING DEATH.

ADDITIONALLY, WE EXAMINED THE UNIQUE INFLUENCE OF LIFETIME TOBACCO USE ON VETERAN MORTALITY WHEN ADDED TO THE COMPLETE MODEL.

THE RISK OF SEVERE COVID-19 IS INCREASED BY CERTAIN UNDERLYING COMORBIDITIES, INCLUDING ASTHMA, CANCER, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, HYPERTENSION, DIABETES, AND OBESITY. NOTABLY, EXPOSURE TO HORMONALLY ACTIVE CHEMICALS CALLED ENDOCRINE-DISRUPTING CHEMICALS (EDCS) CAN PROMOTE SUCH CARDIO-METABOLIC DISEASES, ENDOCRINE-RELATED CANCERS, AND IMMUNE SYSTEM DYSREGULATION AND THUS, MAY ALSO BE LINKED TO HIGHER RISK OF SEVERE COVID-19. BISPHENOL A (BPA) IS AMONG THE MOST COMMON EDCS AND EXERTS ITS EFFECTS VIA RECEPTORS WHICH ARE WIDELY DISTRIBUTED IN HUMAN TISSUES, INCLUDING NUCLEAR OESTROGEN RECEPTORS (ERΑ AND ERΒ), MEMBRANE-BOUND OESTROGEN RECEPTOR (G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR 30; GPR30), AND HUMAN NUCLEAR RECEPTOR OESTROGEN-RELATED RECEPTOR GAMMA.

INTERESTINGLY, GPR30 APPEARS TO EXHIBIT GREATER CO-LOCALISATION WITH TMPRSS2 IN KEY TISSUES LIKE LUNG AND PROSTATE, SUGGESTING THAT BPA EXPOSURE MAY IMPACT ON THE LOCAL EXPRESSION OF THESE SARS-COV-2 INFECTION MEDIATORS.

TO DATE THERE ARE NO DATA RELATING TO SARS-COV-2 IN PCOS WOMEN. THE PRESENT CLINICAL OPINION REPRESENTS A SUMMARY OF THE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE AND POSSIBLE PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS REGARDING PCOS AND COVID-19. PCOS WOMEN COULD BE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO INFECTIONS COMPARED TO NON-PCOS WOMEN. INSULIN RESISTANCE AND THE ASSOCIATED HYPERINSULINAEMIA ARE DRIVERS FOR ENHANCED STEROIDOGENESIS IN WOMEN WITH PCOS. WEIGHT-GAIN AND OBESITY, THROUGH THEIR WORSENING EFFECTS ON INSULIN RESISTANCE, THEREBY DRIVE ENHANCED STEROIDOGENESIS AND HYPERANDROGENISM. ALL THESE FEATURES REPRESENT KEY POINTS TO PROVIDE AN EXPLANATION FOR THE POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN PCOS AND SARS-COV-2. INDEED, ANDROGENS MAY DRIVE CLINICAL RESULTS IN COVID-19, THROUGH THE EXPRESSION OF TMPRSS2, A CELLULAR CO-RECEPTOR NECESSARY FOR SARS-COV-2 INFECTION AND THROUGH ANDROGEN-MEDIATED IMMUNE MODULATION. IN WOMEN WITH PCOS THE ENDOCRINE-IMMUNE AXIS LEADS TO IMMUNE DYSFUNCTION WITH A STATE OF CHRONIC INFLAMMATION, AND HYPERANDROGENISM AND IR WITH COMPENSATORY HYPERGLYCAEMIA COULD PLAY A DETERMINING ROLE IN THE PATHOPHYSIOGENESIS OF THE INFECTION. HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT ONLY SPECIFIC PCOS PHENOTYPES MAY BE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE. IN ADDITION, VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY AND GUT DYSBIOSIS ARE ANOTHER IMPORTANT FACTOR POTENTIALLY INVOLVED IN THE INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING SEVERE FORMS OF COVID-19 IN PCOS WOMEN. FURTHER SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATIONS ARE NEEDED WITH THE AIM OF UNDERSTANDING WHICH WOMEN ARE MOST AT RISK OF BECOMING INFECTED OR DEVELOPING COMPLICATIONS, WHAT ARE THE CAUSAL MECHANISMS ON WHICH IT IS POSSIBLE TO INTERVENE WITH PROPHYLACTIC AND THERAPEUTIC MEASURES AND WHAT THE LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES WILL BE ON THE HEALTH OF THESE PATIENTS."

ABNORMALITIES IN THE RENIN-ANGIOTENSIN-ALDOSTERONE SYSTEM (RAAS), ANGIOTENSIN-CONVERTING ENZYME-2 (ACE2) AND THE ANDROGEN-DRIVEN TRANSMEMBRANE SERINE PROTEASE 2 (TMPRSS2) HAVE BEEN ELICITED AS KEY MODULATORS OF SARS-COV-2.

SEVERAL OTHER CANDIDATES SHOW LESS CONSISTENT PLAUSIBILITY. IN COMMON, EXCEPT FOR DEXAMETHASONE, ALL CANDIDATES HAVE NO EVIDENCE FOR COVID-19, AND CLINICAL TRIALS ARE NEEDED. WHILE DEXAMETHASONE MAY REDUCE MORTALITY IN SEVERELY ILL PATIENTS WITH COVID-19, IN THE ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE OF ANY SPECIFIC DRUG FOR MILD-TO-MODERATE COVID-19, RESEARCHERS SHOULD CONSIDER TESTING EXISTING DRUGS DUE TO THEIR FAVORABLE SAFETY, FAMILIARITY, AND COST PROFILE.

AT THE TIME OF WRITING, SARS-COV-2 HAS INFECTED OVER 5 MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE. A KEY STEP IN UNDERSTANDING THE PATHOBIOLOGY OF THE SARS-COV-2 WAS THE IDENTIFICATION OF -CONVERTING ENZYME 2 (ACE2) AS THE RECEPTOR FOR SARS-COV-2 TO GAIN ENTRY INTO HOST CELLS. ACE2 IS AN ESTABLISHED COMPONENT OF THE 'PROTECTIVE ARM' OF THE RENIN-ANGIOTENSIN-ALDOSTERONE-SYSTEM (RAAS) THAT OPPOSES ACE/ANGIOTENSIN II (ANG II) PRESSOR AND TISSUE REMODELLING ACTIONS. IDENTIFICATION OF ACE2 AS THE ENTRY POINT FOR SARS-COV-2 INTO CELLS QUICKLY FOCUSED ATTENTION ON THE USE OF ACE INHIBITORS (ACEI), ANGIOTENSIN RECEPTOR BLOCKERS (ARB) AND MINERALOCORTICOID RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS (MRA) IN PATIENTS WITH HYPERTENSION AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE GIVEN THAT THESE PHARMACOLOGICAL AGENTS UPREGULATE ACE2 EXPRESSION IN TARGET CELLS. ACE2 IS CLEAVED FROM THE CELLS BY METALLOPROTEASES ADAM10 AND ADAM17. STEROID HORMONE RECEPTORS REGULATE MULTIPLE COMPONENTS OF THE RAAS AND MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE OBSERVED VARIATION IN THE INCIDENCE OF SEVERE COVID-19 BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN, AND IN PATIENTS WITH PRE-EXISTING ENDOCRINE-RELATED DISEASE. MOREOVER, GLUCOCORTICOIDS PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE ACUTE AND CHRONIC MANAGEMENT OF INFLAMMATORY DISEASE, INDEPENDENT OF ANY EFFECT ON RAAS ACTIVITY. DEXAMETHASONE, A SYNTHETIC GLUCOCORTICOID, HAS EMERGED AS A LIFE-SAVING TREATMENT IN SEVERE COVID-19. THIS REVIEW WILL EXAMINE THE ENDOCRINE MECHANISMS THAT CONTROL ACE2 AND DISCUSSES THE IMPACT OF THERAPIES TARGETING THE RAAS, GLUCOCORTICOID AND OTHER ENDOCRINE SYSTEMS FOR THEIR RELEVANCE TO THE IMPACT OF SARS-COV-2 INFECTION AND THE TREATMENT AND RECOVERY FROM COVID-19-RELATED CRITICAL ILLNESS."

THE RESULTS ACROSS MULTIPLE STUDIES WERE NUMERICALLY POOLED TO YIELD TOTAL ESTIMATED. A TOTAL OF 45 STUDIES WERE INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW WITH 14 358 ADULT PARTICIPANTS (AVERAGE AGE 51 YEARS, MALE 51%). THE POOLED FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE MOST COMMON SYMPTOM AMONG PATIENTS WAS FEVER (81.2%) FOLLOWED BY COUGH (62.9%), FATIGUE (38.0%) AND ANOREXIA/LOSS OF APPETITE (33.7%). THE COMORBIDITIES THAT WERE MOST PREVALENT AMONG PATIENTS WITH THE VIRUS WERE HYPERTENSION (19.1%), CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (17.9%), ENDOCRINE DISORDER (9.3%) AND DIABETES (9.2%). ABNORMAL CHEST X-RAY FINDINGS WERE PRESENT IN 27.7% OF PATIENTS AND GROUND-GLASS OPACITY WAS DEMONSTRATED ON CHEST COMPUTERIZED TOMOGRAPHY IN 63.0% OF PATIENTS.

IN THIS REVIEW, WE SUMMARIZE THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE POINTING TO GENDER-RELATED DIFFERENCES IN ACE2 AND TMPRSS2 EXPRESSION, FROM BOTH GENETIC AND ENDOCRINE POINTS OF VIEW. ALTOGETHER, AVAILABLE EVIDENCE POINTS TOWARD TWO NOT-MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE MECHANISMS IN GENDER SUSCEPTIBILITY TO COVID-19 BY SEX HORMONAL REGULATION OF ACE2 AND TMPRSS2. ON ONE HAND, ACE2 EXPRESSION COULD BE INCREASED IN WOMEN, EITHER BY ESTROGENS OR CONSTITUTIVELY BY X CHROMOSOME INACTIVATION ESCAPE OR BY REDUCED METHYLATION, PROVIDING A LARGER RESERVOIR OF ACE2 TO MAINTAIN THE FUNDAMENTAL EQUILIBRIUM OF RAS REGULATORY AXIS. ON THE OTHER, LOW LEVELS OF ANDROGENS IN WOMEN MAY KEEP AT LOW LEVELS TMPRSS2 EXPRESSION, REPRESENTING A FURTHER PROTECTIVE FACTOR FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF COVID-19 INFECTION, DESPITE THE INCREASED EXPRESSION OF ACE2, WHICH REPRESENTS THE TROJAN HORSE FOR SARS-COV-2 ENTRY.

MDT MEMBERS ARE MAINLY PHYSICIANS FROM CRITICAL MEDICINE, INFECTION AND RESPIRATORY DISCIPLINES, BUT ALSO INCLUDE CARDIOVASCULAR, KIDNEY, ENDOCRINE, DIGESTION, NERVE, NUTRITION, REHABILITATION, PSYCHOLOGY AND SPECIALTY CARE. ACCORDING TO A PATIENT'S SPECIFIC DISEASE CONDITION, AN INDIVIDUALIZED DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT PLAN IS FORMULATED (ONE PLAN FOR ONE PATIENT). WHILE SELECTING INDIVIDUALIZED ANTIVIRAL, ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AND IMMUNOMODULATORY TREATMENT, WE ALSO STRENGTHEN NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT, PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERVENTION, COMPREHENSIVE REHABILITATION AND TIMELY AND FULL-COURSE INTERVENTION TO DEVELOP OVERALL AND SPECIAL NURSING PLANS. IN RESPONSE TO THE RAPID PROGRESSION OF SEVERE/CRITICAL PATIENTS, MDT MEMBERS NEED TO ESTABLISH A THREE-DIMENSIONAL MANAGEMENT MODEL WITH CLOSE OBSERVATION AND TIMELY EVALUATION. THE MDT SHOULD MAKE ROUNDS OF THE QUARANTINE WARDS BOTH MORNING AND NIGHT, AND OF CRITICAL PATIENT WARDS NIGHTLY, TO IMPLEMENT \"ROUND-THE-CLOCK ROUNDS MANAGEMENT\", TO ACCURATELY PREDICT DISEASE PROGRESSION, PERFORM THE QUICK INTERVENTION AND PREVENT RAPID DETERIORATION OF THE PATIENT. OUR MDT HAS CUMULATIVELY TREATED 77 SEVERE/CRITICAL COVID-19 CASES, INCLUDING 62 (80.5%) SEVERE CASES AND 15 (19.5%) CRITICAL CASES, WITH AN AVERAGE AGE OF 63.8 YEARS. FIFTY-THREE (68.8%) CASES PRESENTED WITH MORE THAN ONE UNDERLYING DISEASE AND 65 (84.4%) SEVERE CASES RECOVERED FROM COVID-19. THE AVERAGE HOSPITAL STAY OF SEVERE/CRITICAL CASES WAS 22 DAYS, AND THE MORTALITY RATE WAS 2.6%, BOTH OF WHICH WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE 30-40 DAYS AND 49.0-61.5%, RESPECTIVELY, REPORTED IN THE LITERATURE. THEREFORE, A MULTIDISCIPLINARY, THREE-DIMENSIONAL AND INDIVIDUALIZED COMPREHENSIVE TREATMENT PLAN CAN EFFECTIVELY REDUCE THE MORTALITY RATE OF SEVERE/CRITICAL COVID-19 AND IMPROVE THE CURE RATE."

BIVARIATE ANALYSIS WAS USED TO DESCRIBE CHANGES IN HOW SPECIALISTS MANAGED EBC AT THE BEGINNING AND DURING THE PANDEMIC, ACCORDING TO BREAST CANCER SUBTYPE AND ONCOPLASTIC SURGERY. THE RESPONSE RATE WAS 34.4% (503/1462 SPECIALISTS). MOST OF THE RESPONDENTS (324; 64.4%) LIVED IN A STATE CAPITAL CITY, WERE BOARD-CERTIFIED AS BREAST SPECIALISTS (395; 78.5%) AND EITHER WORKED IN AN ACADEMIC INSTITUTE OR ONE ASSOCIATED WITH BREAST CANCER TREATMENT (390; 77.5%). THE BEST RESPONSE RATE WAS FROM THE SOUTHEAST OF THE COUNTRY (240; 47.7%) FOLLOWED BY THE NORTHEAST (128; 25.4%). AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC, 43% CHANGED THEIR MANAGEMENT APPROACH. AS THE OUTBREAK PROGRESSED, THIS PROPORTION INCREASED TO 69.8% (P < 0.001). THE SOUTHEAST OF THE COUNTRY (P = 0.005) AND THE STATE CAPITAL CITIES (P < 0.001) WERE ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC, WHILE BEING FEMALE (P = 0.001) WAS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES DURING THE PANDEMIC. FOR HORMONE RECEPTOR-POSITIVE TUMORS WITH THE BEST PROGNOSIS (KI-67 < 20%), 47.9% AND 17.7% OF SPECIALISTS WOULD RECOMMEND NEOADJUVANT ENDOCRINE THERAPY FOR POSTMENOPAUSAL AND PREMENOPAUSAL WOMEN, RESPECTIVELY. FOR TUMORS WITH POORER PROGNOSIS (KI-67 > 30%), 34% AND 10.9% WOULD RECOMMEND IT FOR POSTMENOPAUSAL AND PREMENOPAUSAL WOMEN, RESPECTIVELY. MENOPAUSAL STATUS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED WHETHER THE SPECIALISTS CHANGED THEIR APPROACH (P < 0.00001). FOR TUMORS ≥ 1.0 CM, 42.9% OF RESPONDENTS WOULD RECOMMEND NEOADJUVANT SYSTEMIC THERAPY FOR TRIPLE-NEGATIVE TUMORS AND 39.6% FOR HER2 + TUMORS. OVERALL, 63.4% WOULD RECOMMEND IMMEDIATE TOTAL BREAST RECONSTRUCTION, WHILE ONLY 3.4% WOULD RECOMMEND AUTOLOGOUS RECONSTRUCTION. IN BREAST-CONSERVING SURGERY, 75% WOULD RECOMMEND PARTIAL BREAST RECONSTRUCTION; HOWEVER, 54.1% WOULD CONTRAINDICATE MAMMOPLASTY. FURTHERMORE, 84.9% OF RESPONDENTS WOULD NOT RECOMMEND PROPHYLACTIC MASTECTOMY IN CASES OF BRCA MUTATION.

WE SYSTEMICALLY EXAMINED OUR COMMUNITY CANCER CENTER DATABASE TO DISPLAY PATTERNS OF CHANGE AND TO UNVEIL FACTORS THAT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED WITH EACH DECISION. WE STUDIED A COHORT OF 282 PATIENTS RECEIVING TREATMENT AND FOUND THAT 159 PATIENTS (56.4%) HAD TREATMENT MODIFICATIONS. THE INCIDENCE OF TREATMENT MODIFICATION WAS OBSERVED IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING ADJUVANT AND NEOADJUVANT (41.4%), PALLIATIVE (62.9%), OR INJECTABLE ENDOCRINE OR BONE-MODULATING ONLY (76.0%) TREATMENTS. MODIFICATIONS WERE APPLIED TO REGIMENS WITH MYELOSUPPRESSIVE (56.5%), IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE (69.2%), AND IMMUNOMODULATING (61.5%) POTENTIALS. THESE MODIFICATIONS ALSO AFFECTED INTRAVENOUS (54.9%) AND SUBCUTANEOUS INJECTABLE TREATMENTS (62.5%) MORE THAN ORAL TREATMENTS (15.8%). TREATMENT MODIFICATIONS IN 112 PATIENTS (70.4%) WERE RECOMMENDED BY PROVIDERS, AND 47 (29.6%) WERE INITIATED BY PATIENTS. THE MOST COMMON STRATEGY OF MODIFICATION WAS TO SKIP OR POSTPONE A SCHEDULED TREATMENT (49%). AMONG TREATMENT WITH NO MODIFICATIONS, TREATMENT REGIMENS WERE MAINTAINED IN PATIENTS WHO TOLERATED TREATMENT WELL (37.0%), IN TREATMENTS WITH CURATIVE INTENT (22%), AND IN SYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS WHO REQUIRED TREATMENT (14%). OUR OBSERVATION AND ANALYSIS SUGGESTED THAT THE PRIMARY GOAL OF TREATMENT MODIFICATION WAS TO DECREASE POTENTIAL EXPOSURE.

ACE2, AN 805-AMINO ACID MONOCARBOXYPEPTIDASE TYPE I TRANSMEMBRANE GLYCOPROTEIN, WAS DISCOVERED IN 2000 AND HAS SEQUENCE SIMILARITY TO TWO OTHER PROTEINS, NAMELY ACE AND COLLECTRIN. THE ACE2 GENE IS LOCATED ON XP22 AND IS HIGHLY POLYMORPHIC. ACE2 IS EXPRESSED IN NUMEROUS TISSUES ESPECIALLY THE LUNG ALVEOLAR EPITHELIAL CELLS, HEART, KIDNEY AND GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT. ANIMAL STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT ACE2 IS CENTRAL IN DISEASES AFFECTING ALMOST ALL ORGAN SYSTEMS, AMONG OTHER CARDIAC, RESPIRATORY, RENAL AND ENDOCRINE FUNCTIONS. ACE2 WAS IDENTIFIED AS THE CELLULAR CONTACT POINT FOR SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME CORONAVIRUS 2 (SARS-COV-2), THE CAUSE OF THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC (COVID-19), AND IS A POTENTIAL DRUG TARGET.

WE DESCRIBE THE GENETICS AND FUNCTIONS OF ACE2, EXPLORE ITS VARIOUS PHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS IN THE RENIN-ANGIOTENSIN SYSTEM AND DISCUSS ITS ROLE IN THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF DISEASE. ACE2 OPPOSES THE VASOPRESSOR ACE PATHWAY OF THE RENIN-ANGIOTENSIN SYSTEM BY CONVERTING ANGIOTENSIN (ANG) I TO ANG (1-9) AND ANG II TO ANG (1-7) WHICH INITIATES THE VASODILATORY PATHWAY.

TO COMPILE A MINI-REVIEW DESCRIBING POSSIBLE ENDOCRINE CONSEQUENCES OF SARS-COV-2 INFECTION, WE PERFORMED A LITERATURE SURVEY USING THE KEY WORDS COVID-19, CORONAVIRUS, SARS COV-1, SARS COV-2, ENDOCRINE, AND RELATED TERMS IN MEDICAL DATABASES INCLUDING PUBMED, GOOGLE SCHOLAR, AND MEDARXIV FROM THE YEAR 2000.

IN LIGHT OF THE LITERATURE, WE DISCUSS SARS-COV-2 AND EXPLORE THE ENDOCRINE CONSEQUENCES BASED ON THE EXPERIENCE WITH STRUCTURALLY-SIMILAR SARS-COV-1. STUDIES FROM THE SARS -COV-1 EPIDEMIC HAVE REPORTED VARIABLE CHANGES IN THE ENDOCRINE ORGANS. SARS-COV-2 ATTACHES TO THE ACE2 SYSTEM IN THE PANCREAS CAUSING PERTURBATION OF INSULIN PRODUCTION RESULTING IN HYPERGLYCEMIC EMERGENCIES.

GASTROINTESTINAL SYMPTOMS ARE ALSO FREQUENTLY ENCOUNTERED AND MAY PERSIST FOR SEVERAL DAYS. HAEMATOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS ARE FREQUENT AS WELL AND HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH POOR PROGNOSIS. FURTHERMORE, RECENT STUDIES HAVE REPORTED THAT OVER A THIRD OF INFECTED PATIENTS DEVELOP A BROAD SPECTRUM OF NEUROLOGICAL SYMPTOMS AFFECTING THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM, PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM AND SKELETAL MUSCLES, INCLUDING ANOSMIA AND AGEUSIA. THE SKIN, THE KIDNEYS, THE LIVER, THE ENDOCRINE ORGANS AND THE EYES ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY THE SYSTEMIC COVID-19 DISEASE.

SINCE THE RAAS CAN INDUCE AND MODULATE PRO-INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES, IT COULD PLAY A KEY ROLE IN THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF COVID-19. THUS, WE AIMED TO DETERMINE THE LEVELS OF PLASMA RENIN AND ALDOSTERONE AS INDICATORS OF RAAS ACTIVATION IN A SERIES OF CONSECUTIVELY ADMITTED PATIENTS FOR COVID-19 IN OUR CLINIC. PLASMA RENIN AND ALDOSTERONE LEVELS WERE MEASURED, AMONG THE MISCELLANEOUS INVESTIGATIONS NEEDED FOR COVID-19 MANAGEMENT, EARLY AFTER ADMISSION IN OUR CLINIC. DISEASE SEVERITY WAS ASSESSED USING A SEVEN-CATEGORY ORDINAL SCALE. PRIMARY OUTCOME OF INTEREST WAS THE SEVERITY OF PATIENTS' CLINICAL COURSES. FORTY-FOUR PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED. AT INCLUSION, 12 PATIENTS HAD MILD CLINICAL STATUS, 25 MODERATE CLINICAL STATUS AND 7 SEVERE CLINICAL STATUS. IN UNIVARIATE ANALYSES, ALDOSTERONE AND C-REACTIVE PROTEIN (CRP) LEVELS AT INCLUSION WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN PATIENTS WITH SEVERE CLINICAL COURSE AS COMPARED TO THOSE WITH MILD OR MODERATE COURSE (  < 0.01 AND   = 0.03, RESPECTIVELY). IN MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES, ONLY ALDOSTERONE AND CRP LEVELS REMAINED POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH SEVERITY. WE ALSO OBSERVED A POSITIVE SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION BETWEEN ALDOSTERONE AND CRP LEVELS AMONG PATIENTS WITH AN ALDOSTERONE LEVEL GREATER THAN 102.5 PMOL/L. BOTH PLASMATIC ALDOSTERONE AND CRP LEVELS AT INCLUSION ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE CLINICAL COURSE OF COVID-19.

IT IS INVOLVED IN >600 ENZYMATIC REACTIONS IN THE BODY, INCLUDING THOSE CONTRIBUTING TO THE EXAGGERATED IMMUNE AND INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES EXHIBITED BY COVID-19 PATIENTS.  A SUMMARY OF EXPERIMENTAL FINDINGS AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE BIOCHEMICAL ROLE MAGNESIUM MAY PLAY IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF COVID-19 IS PRESENTED IN THIS PERSPECTIVE. THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF MEDICINE'S STANDARDS FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS WERE INDEPENDENTLY EMPLOYED TO IDENTIFY CLINICAL AND PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDIES ASSESSING THE RELATIONSHIP OF MAGNESIUM WITH INTERLEUKIN-6, A PROMINENT DRUG TARGET FOR TREATING COVID-19.  CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS ARE GIVEN FOR PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF COVID-19. CONSTANT MONITORING OF IONIZED MAGNESIUM STATUS WITH SUBSEQUENT REPLETION, WHEN APPROPRIATE, MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY TO INFLUENCE DISEASE CONTRACTION AND PROGRESSION. THE PEER-REVIEWED LITERATURE SUPPORTS THAT SEVERAL ASPECTS OF MAGNESIUM NUTRITION WARRANT CLINICAL CONSIDERATION. MECHANISMS INCLUDE ITS \"CALCIUM-CHANNEL BLOCKING\" EFFECTS THAT LEAD TO DOWNSTREAM SUPPRESSION OF NUCLEAR FACTOR-KΒ, INTERLEUKIN-6, C-REACTIVE PROTEIN, AND OTHER RELATED ENDOCRINE DISRUPTERS; ITS ROLE IN REGULATING RENAL POTASSIUM LOSS; AND ITS ABILITY TO ACTIVATE AND ENHANCE THE FUNCTIONALITY OF VITAMIN D, AMONG OTHERS.

THE PANDEMIC HAS CAUSED GREAT HARM TO SOCIETY AND CAUSED SERIOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA TO MANY PEOPLE. CHILDREN ARE A VULNERABLE GROUP IN THIS GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY, AS THEIR NERVOUS SYSTEMS, ENDOCRINE SYSTEMS, AND HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY-ADRENAL AXES ARE NOT WELL DEVELOPED. PSYCHOLOGICAL CRISES OFTEN CAUSE CHILDREN TO PRODUCE FEELINGS OF ABANDONMENT, DESPAIR, INCAPACITY, AND EXHAUSTION, AND EVEN RAISE THE RISK OF SUICIDE. CHILDREN WITH MENTAL ILLNESSES ARE ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE DURING THE QUARANTINE AND SOCIAL DISTANCING PERIOD. THE INCLUSION OF PSYCHOSOCIAL SUPPORT FOR CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE PART OF THE HEALTH RESPONSES TO DISASTER AND DISASTER RECOVERY. BASED ON THE BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL MODEL, SOME CHILDREN MAY HAVE CATASTROPHIC THOUGHTS AND BE PRONE TO EXPERIENCE DESPAIR, NUMBNESS, FLASHBACKS, AND OTHER SERIOUS EMOTIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL REACTIONS. IN SEVERE CASES, THERE MAY BE SYMPTOMS OF PSYCHOSIS OR POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER. TIMELY AND APPROPRIATE PROTECTIONS ARE NEEDED TO PREVENT THE OCCURRENCE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS. THE EMERGING DIGITAL APPLICATIONS AND HEALTH SERVICES SUCH AS TELEHEALTH, SOCIAL MEDIA, MOBILE HEALTH, AND REMOTE INTERACTIVE ONLINE EDUCATION ARE ABLE TO BRIDGE THE SOCIAL DISTANCE AND SUPPORT MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FOR CHILDREN. BASED ON THE PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT CHARACTERISTICS OF CHILDREN, THIS STUDY ALSO ILLUSTRATES INTERVENTIONS ON THE PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT FROM THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. EVEN THOUGH THE WORLD HAS BEEN STRUGGLING TO CURB THE INFLUENCES OF THE PANDEMIC, THE QUARANTINE AND SOCIAL DISTANCING POLICIES WILL HAVE LONG-TERM IMPACTS ON CHILDREN.

USING THE DISTRIBUTED SERVICE PLATFORM OF PHC, A TRAINED HEALTHCARE WORKER WITH APPROPRIATE TESTING KITS CAN SCREEN HIGH-RISK INDIVIDUALS AND CAN HELP OPTIMIZE TRIAGE TO MEDICAL SERVICES. PHC WITH ITS NEW TRIAGE ALGORITHM (C-LOGIC) CLASSIFIES THE PATIENTS ACCORDING TO WHETHER THE PATIENT NEEDS TO MOVE TO A CLINIC FOR A PCR TEST. THROUGH MODIFIED PHC SERVICE, WE CAN HELP PEOPLE TO BOOST THEIR KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDE (FEELINGS/BELIEFS), AND SELF-EFFICACY TO EXECUTE PREVENTING MEASURES. OUR INITIAL EXAMINATION OF THE SUITABILITY OF THE PHC AND ITS ASSOCIATED TECHNOLOGIES AS A KEY CONTRIBUTOR TO PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSES IS DESIGNED TO \"FLATTEN THE CURVE\", PARTICULARLY AMONG UNREACHED HIGH-RISK NCD POPULATIONS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.

WITH THE PANDEMIC, ALL ELECTIVE SURGERIES AND NON-EMERGENCY PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN POSTPONED IN OUR COUNTRY, AS IN OTHERS. MOST OF THE ENDOCRINE OPERATIONS CAN BE POSTPONED FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD. HOWEVER, IT MUST BE KEPT IN MIND THAT THESE PATIENTS ALSO NEED SURGICAL TREATMENT, AND THE DELAY TIME SHOULD NOT CAUSE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE SURGICAL OUTCOME OR DISEASE PROCESS. IT HAS RECENTLY BEEN SUGGESTED THAT ELECTIVE SURGICAL INTERVENTIONS CAN BE DESCRIBED AS MEDICALLY NECESSARY, TIME-SENSITIVE (MENTS) PROCEDURES. SOME GUIDELINES HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED ON PROPER AND SAFE SURGERY FOR BOTH THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND THE PATIENTS AFTER THE IMMEDIATE ONSET OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. WE SHOULD KNOW THAT THESE GUIDELINES AND RECOMMENDATIONS ARE NOT MEANT TO CONSTITUTE A POSITION STATEMENT, THE STANDARD OF CARE, OR EVIDENCE-BASED/BEST PRACTICE.

WE PRESENT AN EXPERIMENTAL PLATFORM COMPRISED OF CELL AND ORGANOID DERIVATIVES FROM HUMAN PLURIPOTENT STEM CELLS (HPSCS). A SPIKE-ENABLED PSEUDO-ENTRY VIRUS INFECTS PANCREATIC ENDOCRINE CELLS, LIVER ORGANOIDS, CARDIOMYOCYTES, AND DOPAMINERGIC NEURONS. RECENT CLINICAL STUDIES SHOW A STRONG ASSOCIATION WITH COVID-19 AND DIABETES. WE FIND THAT HUMAN PANCREATIC BETA CELLS AND LIVER ORGANOIDS ARE HIGHLY PERMISSIVE TO SARS-COV-2 INFECTION, FURTHER VALIDATED USING ADULT PRIMARY HUMAN ISLETS AND ADULT HEPATOCYTE AND CHOLANGIOCYTE ORGANOIDS. SARS-COV-2 INFECTION CAUSED STRIKING EXPRESSION OF CHEMOKINES, AS ALSO SEEN IN PRIMARY HUMAN COVID-19 PULMONARY AUTOPSY SAMPLES.

SEVERAL FACTORS MAY BE INVOLVED IN THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN COVID-19 AND PSYCHIATRIC OUTCOMES, SUCH AS FEAR INHERENT IN THE PANDEMIC, ADVERSE EFFECTS OF TREATMENTS, AS WELL AS FINANCIAL STRESS, AND SOCIAL ISOLATION. HEREIN WE DISCUSS THE GROWING EVIDENCE SUGGESTING THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SARS-COV-2 AND HOST MAY ALSO TRIGGER CHANGES IN BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR. BASED ON THE SIMILARITY OF SARS-COV-2 WITH OTHER CORONAVIRUSES, IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT CHANGES IN ENDOCRINE AND IMMUNE RESPONSE IN THE PERIPHERY OR IN THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM MAY BE INVOLVED IN THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SARS-COV-2 INFECTION AND IMPAIRED MENTAL HEALTH. THIS IS LIKELY TO BE FURTHER ENHANCED, SINCE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WORLDWIDE ARE ISOLATED IN QUARANTINE TO MINIMIZE THE TRANSMISSION OF SARS-COV-2 AND SOCIAL ISOLATION CAN ALSO LEAD TO NEUROENDOCRINE-IMMUNE CHANGES.

THE AIM OF OUR SURVEY WAS TO PROVIDE A REAL TIME INTERNATIONAL SNAPSHOT OF MODIFICATIONS OF BREAST CANCER MANAGEMENT DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. A SURVEY WAS DEVELOPED BY A MULTIDISCIPLINARY GROUP ON BEHALF OF EUROPEAN BREAST CANCER RESEARCH ASSOCIATION OF SURGICAL TRIALISTS AND DISTRIBUTED VIA BREAST CANCER SOCIETIES. ONE REPLY PER BREAST UNIT WAS REQUESTED. IN TEN DAYS, 377 BREAST CENTRES FROM 41 COUNTRIES COMPLETED THE QUESTIONNAIRE. RT-PCR TESTING FOR SARS-COV-2 PRIOR TO TREATMENT WAS REPORTED BY 44.8% OF THE INSTITUTIONS. THE ESTIMATED TIME INTERVAL BETWEEN DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT INITIATION INCREASED FOR ABOUT 20% OF INSTITUTIONS. INDICATIONS FOR PRIMARY SYSTEMIC THERAPY WERE MODIFIED IN 56% (211/377), WITH UPFRONT SURGERY INCREASING FROM 39.8% TO 50.7% (P < 0.002) AND FROM 33.7% TO 42.2% (P < 0.016) IN T1CN0 TRIPLE-NEGATIVE AND ER-NEGATIVE/HER2-POSITIVE CASES, RESPECTIVELY. SIXTY-SEVEN PERCENT CONSIDERED THAT CHEMOTHERAPY INCREASES RISKS FOR DEVELOPING COVID-19 COMPLICATIONS. FIFTY-ONE PERCENT OF THE RESPONDERS REPORTED MODIFICATIONS IN CHEMOTHERAPY PROTOCOLS. GENE-EXPRESSION PROFILE USED TO EVALUATE THE NEED FOR ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY INCREASED IN 18.8%. IN LUMINAL-A TUMOURS, A LARGE MAJORITY (68%) RECOMMENDED ENDOCRINE TREATMENT TO POSTPONE SURGERY. POSTOPERATIVE RADIATION THERAPY WAS POSTPONED IN 20% OF THE CASES. BREAST CANCER MANAGEMENT WAS CONSIDERABLY MODIFIED DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.

THE RAS IS A COMPLICATED NETWORK OF G-PROTEIN COUPLED RECEPTORS (GPCRS) (I.E., AT1R, AT2R, MASR, AND MRGD) ORCHESTRATING THE EFFECTS OF SEVERAL HORMONES (I.E., ANGIOTENSIN II, ANGIOTENSIN (1-7), AND ALAMANDINE) PRODUCED BY PROTEASE-BASED TRANSMEMBRANE RECEPTORS (ACE1 AND ACE2). TWO SIGNALING AXES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN THE RAS ENDOCRINE SYSTEM THAT MEDIATE THE PROLIFERATIVE ACTIONS OF ANGIOTENSIN II (I.E., THE AT1R-BASED PATHWAY) OR THE ANTI-PROLIFERATIVE EFFECTS OF RAS HORMONES (I.E., THE AT2R-, MAS-, AND MRGD-BASED PATHWAYS). DISRUPTION OF THE BALANCE BETWEEN THESE TWO AXES CAN CAUSE DIFFERENT DISEASES (E.G., CARDIOVASCULAR PATHOLOGIES AND THE SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME CORONAVIRUS 2- (SARS-COV-2)-BASED COVID-19 DISEASE).

TO GIVE AN INDICATION OF POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS, THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED EXCESS MORTALITY PATTERNS DURING A PREVIOUS INFLUENZA EPIDEMIC. USING DUTCH POPULATION AND MORTALITY REGISTERS, A HISTORICAL COHORT STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO COMPARE MORTALITY DURING THE 2017-2018 INFLUENZA EPIDEMIC WITH MORTALITY IN THE SAME PERIOD IN THE THREE PREVIOUS YEARS. PEOPLE WITH ID WERE IDENTIFIED BY ENTITLEMENTS TO RESIDENTIAL ID-CARE SERVICES AS RETRIEVED FROM A NATIONAL DATABASE. DATA COVERED THE ENTIRE ADULT DUTCH POPULATION (12.6 MILLION; GENPOP), OF WHICH 91 064 INDIVIDUALS WERE IDENTIFIED WITH AN ID. DURING THE INFLUENZA EPIDEMIC, MORTALITY AMONG PEOPLE WITH ID INCREASED ALMOST THREE TIMES AS MUCH THAN IN THE GENPOP (15.2% VS. 5.4%), AND MORE AMONG MALE INDIVIDUALS WITH ID (+19.5%) THAN AMONG FEMALE INDIVIDUALS WITH ID (+10.6%), AS COMPARED WITH BASELINE. IN BOTH COHORTS, COMPARABLE INCREASES IN MORTALITY WITHIN OLDER AGE GROUPS AND DUE TO RESPIRATORY CAUSES WERE SEEN. PARTICULARLY IN THE ID-COHORT, EXCESS DEATHS ALSO OCCURRED IN YOUNGER AGE GROUPS, DUE TO ENDOCRINE DISEASES AND ID-SPECIFIC CAUSES. DURING THE 2017-2018 INFLUENZA EPIDEMIC, EXCESS MORTALITY AMONG PEOPLE WITH ID WAS THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN IN THE GENERAL DUTCH POPULATION, APPEARED MORE OFTEN AT YOUNG AGE AND WITH A BROADER RANGE OF UNDERLYING CAUSES.

THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF LARYNGOPHARYNGEAL REFLUX DISEASE (LPRD) ON HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS WITH CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19). WE EXTRACTED CLINICAL DATA REGARDING 95 PATIENTS IN WUHAN JINYINTAN HOSPITAL, WUHAN, CHINA, BETWEEN 26 JANUARY AND 21 FEBRUARY 2020. THE REFLUX SYMPTOM INDEX (RSI) WAS USED TO ASSESS THE PRESENCE AND SEVERITY OF LPRD. AN RSI  GREATER THAN  13 IS CONSIDERED TO BE ABNORMAL. A TOTAL OF 95 PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 WERE ENROLLED, WITH 61.1% (58/95), 32.6% (31/95), AND 6.3% (6/95) BEING MODERATELY ILL, SEVERELY ILL, AND CRITICALLY ILL, RESPECTIVELY. IN THIS STUDY, 38.9% (37/95) OF THE PATIENT HAD AN RSI SCORE OVER 13, WHICH WAS INDICATIVE OF LPRD. IN UNIVARIABLE ANALYSIS, THE AGE AND RSI SCORES OF SEVERELY OR CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN PATIENTS WITH MODERATE DISEASE (P  =  .026 AND P = .005, RESPECTIVELY). AFTER CONTROLLING FOR AGE DIFFERENCE IN A MULTIVARIABLE MODEL, THE RSI GREATER THAN 13, COMPARED TO RSI EQUAL TO  0, WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER RISK OF SEVERE INFECTION (P < .001; ODDS RATIO [OR] = 11.411; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI], 2.95-42.09) AND CRITICAL INFECTION (P = .028; OR= 19.61; 95% CI, 1.38-277.99). AMONG HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS WITH COVID-19, RSI SCORES GREATER THAN 13, INDICATIVE OF LPRD, CORRELATED WITH POORER CLINICAL OUTCOMES. THE PREVALENCE OF LPRD MAY BE HIGHER THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION, WHICH INDICATED THAT COVID-19 CAN IMPAIR THE UPPER ESOPHAGEAL SPHINCTER AND AGGRAVATE REFLUX."

THIS PAPER DESCRIBES THE IMPACT OF SEDENTARISM ON THE HUMAN BODY AT THE LEVEL OF THE MUSCULAR, CARDIOVASCULAR, METABOLIC, ENDOCRINE AND NERVOUS SYSTEMS AND IS BASED ON EVIDENCE FROM SEVERAL MODELS OF INACTIVITY, INCLUDING BED REST, UNILATERAL LIMB SUSPENSION, AND STEP-REDUCTION. DATA FORM THESE STUDIES SHOW THAT MUSCLE WASTING OCCURS RAPIDLY, BEING DETECTABLE WITHIN TWO DAYS OF INACTIVITY. THIS LOSS OF MUSCLE MASS IS ASSOCIATED WITH FIBRE DENERVATION, NEUROMUSCULAR JUNCTION DAMAGE AND UPREGULATION OF PROTEIN BREAKDOWN, BUT IS MOSTLY EXPLAINED BY THE SUPPRESSION OF MUSCLE PROTEIN SYNTHESIS. INACTIVITY ALSO AFFECTS GLUCOSE HOMEOSTASIS AS JUST FEW DAYS OF STEP REDUCTION OR BED REST, REDUCE INSULIN SENSITIVITY, PRINCIPALLY IN MUSCLE. ADDITIONALLY, AEROBIC CAPACITY IS IMPAIRED AT ALL LEVELS OF THE O  CASCADE, FROM THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM, INCLUDING PERIPHERAL CIRCULATION, TO SKELETAL MUSCLE OXIDATIVE FUNCTION. POSITIVE ENERGY BALANCE DURING PHYSICAL INACTIVITY IS ASSOCIATED WITH FAT DEPOSITION, ASSOCIATED WITH SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION AND ACTIVATION OF ANTIOXIDANT DEFENCES, EXACERBATING MUSCLE LOSS. IMPORTANTLY, THESE DELETERIOUS EFFECTS OF INACTIVITY CAN BE DIMINISHED BY ROUTINE EXERCISE PRACTICE, BUT THE EXERCISE DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIP IS CURRENTLY UNKNOWN. NEVERTHELESS, LOW TO MEDIUM-INTENSITY HIGH VOLUME RESISTIVE EXERCISE, EASILY IMPLEMENTABLE IN HOME-SETTINGS, WILL HAVE POSITIVE EFFECTS, PARTICULARLY IF COMBINED WITH A 15-25% REDUCTION IN DAILY ENERGY INTAKE. THIS COMBINED REGIMEN SEEMS IDEAL FOR PRESERVING NEUROMUSCULAR, METABOLIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH.  THIS PAPER DESCRIBES THE IMPACT OF SEDENTARISM, CAUSED BY THE COVID-19 HOME CONFINEMENT ON THE NEUROMUSCULAR, CARDIOVASCULAR, METABOLIC AND ENDOCRINE SYSTEMS.JUST FEW DAYS OF SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE ARE SUFFICIENT TO INDUCE MUSCLE LOSS, NEUROMUSCULAR JUNCTION DAMAGE AND FIBRE DENERVATION, INSULIN RESISTANCE, DECREASED AEROBIC CAPACITY, FAT DEPOSITION AND LOW-GRADE SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION.REGULAR LOW/MEDIUM INTENSITY HIGH VOLUME EXERCISE, TOGETHER WITH A 15-25% REDUCTION IN CALORIC INTAKE ARE RECOMMENDED FOR PRESERVING NEUROMUSCULAR, CARDIOVASCULAR, METABOLIC AND ENDOCRINE HEALTH."

COVID-19 DISEASE SEVERITY IS WORSE IN OLDER OBESE PATIENTS WITH COMORBIDITIES SUCH AS DIABETES, HYPERTENSION, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, AND CHRONIC LUNG DISEASE. CELL BINDING AND ENTRY OF BETACORONAVIRUSES IS VIA THEIR SURFACE SPIKE GLYCOPROTEIN; SARS-COV BINDS TO THE METALLOPROTEASE ANGIOTENSIN-CONVERTING ENZYME 2 (ACE2), MERS-COV UTILIZES DIPEPTIDYL PEPTIDASE 4 (DPP4), AND RECENT MODELING OF THE STRUCTURE OF SARS-COV-2 SPIKE GLYCOPROTEIN PREDICTS THAT IT CAN INTERACT WITH HUMAN DPP4 IN ADDITION TO ACE2. DPP4 IS A UBIQUITOUS MEMBRANE-BOUND AMINOPEPTIDASE THAT CIRCULATES IN PLASMA; IT IS MULTIFUNCTIONAL WITH ROLES IN NUTRITION, METABOLISM, AND IMMUNE AND ENDOCRINE SYSTEMS. DPP4 ACTIVITY DIFFERENTIALLY REGULATES GLUCOSE HOMEOSTASIS AND INFLAMMATION VIA ITS ENZYMATIC ACTIVITY AND NONENZYMATIC IMMUNOMODULATORY EFFECTS. THE IMPORTANCE OF DPP4 FOR THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY HAS BEEN HIGHLIGHTED BY THE APPROVAL OF DPP4 INHIBITORS, OR GLIPTINS, FOR THE TREATMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS. THIS REVIEW DISCUSSES THE DYSREGULATION OF DPP4 IN COVID-19 COMORBID CONDITIONS; DPP4 ACTIVITY IS HIGHER IN OLDER INDIVIDUALS AND INCREASED PLASMA DPP4 IS A PREDICTOR OF THE ONSET OF METABOLIC SYNDROME. DPP4 UPREGULATION MAY BE A DETERMINANT OF COVID-19 DISEASE SEVERITY, WHICH CREATES INTEREST REGARDING THE USE OF GLIPTINS IN MANAGEMENT OF COVID-19. ALSO, KNOWLEDGE OF THE CHEMISTRY AND BIOLOGY OF DPP4 COULD BE UTILIZED TO DEVELOP NOVEL THERAPIES TO BLOCK VIRAL ENTRY OF SOME BETACORONAVIRUSES, POTENTIALLY INCLUDING SARS-COV-2."

BY REVIEWING THE EXISTING LITERATURE, THIS PAPER ANALYZES THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF PREGNANT WOMEN TO VIRUS, ESPECIALLY TO SARS-COV-2, FROM THE ASPECTS OF ANATOMICAL, REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINE AND IMMUNE CHANGES DURING PREGNANCY AND SCREENS EFFECTIVE AND FETAL-SAFE TREATMENTS FROM THE EXISTING DRUGS. THE ANATOMICAL STRUCTURE OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM IS CHANGED DURING PREGNANCY, AND THE VIRUS TRANSMITTED BY DROPLETS AND AEROSOLS IS MORE EASILY INHALED BY PREGNANT WOMEN AND IS DIFFICULT TO REMOVE. FURTHERMORE, THE PROGNOSIS IS WORSE AFTER INFECTION WHEN COMPARED WITH NON-PREGNANCY WOMEN. AND CHANGES IN REPRODUCTIVE HORMONES AND IMMUNE SYSTEMS DURING PREGNANCY COLLECTIVELY MAKE THEM MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO CERTAIN INFECTIONS. MORE IMPORTANTLY, ANGIOTENSIN-CONVERTING ENZYME (ACE)-2, THE SARS-COV-2 RECEPTOR, HAS BEEN PROVEN HIGHLY INCREASED DURING PREGNANCY, WHICH MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE SUSCEPTIBILITY TO SARS-COV-2. WHEN IT COMES TO TREATMENT, SPECIFIC DRUGS FOR COVID-19 HAVE NOT BEEN FOUND AT PRESENT, AND TAKING OLD DRUGS FOR NEW USE IN TREATING COVID-19 HAS BECOME AN EMERGENCY METHOD FOR THE PANDEMIC. PARTICULARLY, DRUGS THAT SHOW SUPERIOR MATERNAL AND FETAL SAFETY ARE WORTHY OF CONSIDERATION FOR PREGNANT WOMEN WITH COVID-19, SUCH AS CHLOROQUINE, METFORMIN, STATINS, LOBINAVIR/RITONAVIR, GLYCYRRHIZIC ACID, AND NANOPARTICLE-MEDIATED DRUG DELIVERY (NMDD), ETC. PREGNANT WOMEN ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO COVID-19, AND SPECIAL ATTENTION SHOULD BE PAID TO THE SELECTION OF DRUGS THAT ARE BOTH EFFECTIVE FOR MATERNAL DISEASES AND FRIENDLY TO THE FETUS. HOWEVER, THERE ARE STILL MANY DEFICIENCIES IN THE STUDY OF DRUG SAFETY DURING PREGNANCY, AND BROAD-SPECTRUM, EFFECTIVE AND FETAL-SAFE DRUGS FOR PREGNANT WOMEN NEED TO BE DEVELOPED SO AS TO COPE WITH MORE INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN THE FUTURE."

THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO DESCRIBE THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF COVID-19 IN THE ASEAN FEDERATION OF ENDOCRINE SOCIETIES (AFES) MEMBER COUNTRIES; TO DESCRIBE CHALLENGES, CHANGES AND OPPORTUNITIES IN CARING FOR PATIENTS WITH ENDOCRINE DISEASES, AS WELL AS IN FELLOWSHIP TRAINING PROGRAMS, AND ENDOCRINERELATED RESEARCH IN THE AFES COUNTRIES. THE  SEAN  URVEY  F  EEDS IN  NDOCRINOLOGY   WAS AN OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONNAIRE THAT WAS SENT TO THE PRESIDENTS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE AFES MEMBER COUNTRIES BY EMAIL. RESPONSES FROM SOCIETIES WERE COLLATED AND SYNTHESIZED TO OBTAIN PERSPECTIVES ON THE EMERGENT ISSUES IN ENDOCRINOLOGY IN THE SOUTHEAST ASIAN REGION DURING THIS PANDEMIC. THE BURDEN OF COVID-19 CASES VARIED WIDELY ACROSS THE AFES MEMBER COUNTRIES, WITH THE LEAST NUMBER OF CASES IN VIETNAM AND MYANMAR, AND THE GREATEST NUMBER OF CASES IN EITHER THE MOST POPULOUS COUNTRIES (INDONESIA AND THE PHILIPPINES), OR A COUNTRY WITH THE HIGHEST CAPABILITY FOR TESTING (SINGAPORE). THE CASE FATALITY RATE WAS ALSO THE HIGHEST FOR INDONESIA AND THE PHILIPPINES AT AROUND 6%, AND LOWEST FOR VIETNAM AT NO FATALITIES. THE PERCENTAGE WITH DIABETES AMONG PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 RANGED FROM 5% IN INDONESIA TO 20% IN SINGAPORE, APPROXIMATING THE REPORTED PERCENTAGES IN CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES. THE MAJOR CHALLENGES IN MANAGING PATIENTS WITH ENDOCRINE DISEASES INVOLVED INACCESSIBILITY OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, CLINICS AND HOSPITALS DUE TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LOCKDOWNS, COMMUNITY QUARANTINES OR MOVEMENT CONTROL AMONG THE MEMBER COUNTRIES. THIS LED TO DISRUPTIONS IN THE CONTINUITY OF CARE, TESTING AND MONITORING, AND FOR SOME, PROVISION OF BOTH PREVENTIVE CARE AND ACTIVE MANAGEMENT INCLUDING SURGERY FOR THYROID CANCER OR PITUITARY AND ADRENAL TUMORS, AND RADIOACTIVE IODINE THERAPY. MAJOR DISRUPTIONS IN THE ENDOCRINE FELLOWSHIP TRAINING PROGRAMS WERE ALSO NOTED ACROSS THE REGION, SO THAT SOME COUNTRIES HAVE HAD TO FREEZE HIRING OF NEW TRAINEES OR TO REVISE BOTH PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS AND APPROACHES TO TRAINING DUE TO THE CLOSURE OF OUTPATIENT ENDOCRINE CLINICS. THE SAME OBSERVATIONS ARE SEEN FOR ENDOCRINE-RELATED RESEARCHES, AS MOST RESEARCH PAPERS HAVE FOCUSED ON THE PANDEMIC. FINALLY, THE REPORT ENDS BY DESCRIBING INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO FILL IN THE GAP IN TRAINING AND IN IMPROVING PATIENT ACCESS TO ENDOCRINE SERVICES BY TELEMEDICINE. THE BURDEN OF COVID-19 CASES AND ITS CASE FATALITY RATE VARIES ACROSS THE AFES MEMBER COUNTRIES BUT ITS IMPACT IS ALMOST UNIFORM: IT HAS DISRUPTED THE PROVISION OF CARE FOR PATIENTS WITH ENDOCRINE DISEASES, AND HAS ALSO DISRUPTED ENDOCRINE FELLOWSHIP TRAINING AND ENDOCRINE-RELATED RESEARCH ACROSS THE REGION. TELEMEDICINE AND INNOVATIONS IN TRAINING HAVE BEEN OPERATIONALIZED ACROSS THE AFES COUNTRIES IN AN ATTEMPT TO COPE WITH THE DISRUPTIONS FROM COVID-19, BUT ITS OVER-ALL IMPACT ON THE PRACTICE OF ENDOCRINOLOGY ACROSS THE REGION WILL ONLY BECOME APPARENT ONCE WE CONQUER THIS PANDEMIC."
